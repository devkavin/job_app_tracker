How did you approach the problem and what was the outcome?\n\nI worked on a project where I faced a challenging issue with a select dropdown in a CMS. The problem arose because the icon class names were dynamically loaded from a large JSON file during page load, causing the page to either partially load or fail to load completely.\n\nTo address this issue, I began by carefully inspecting the page loading process using chrome dev tools and the structure of the JSON file that contained the icon class names. My solution involved using AJAX to ensure that the icon class names were fetched only when the user interacted with the dropdown. This required changing some of the backend controller code to integrate with the JSON data and optimizing the loading process with caching to improve performance.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, we successfully resolved the loading issue and ensured that the correct icons were loaded and applied where necessary. This experience significantly enhanced my problem identifying and problem solving abilities and reinforced the importance of planning and troubleshooting in achieving project success.",
